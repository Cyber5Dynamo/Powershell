- **Get-Unicorns.ps1** 🦄: A script to list all the unicorns in your local domain. (Just kidding, but wouldn’t that be cool?)
- **Backup-Dragons.ps1** 🐉: A reliable backup script with a touch of dragon fire.
- **Invoke-Spells.ps1** 🧙‍♀️: Invoke common spells to automate your daily wizardry tasks.
- **Measure-Magic.ps1** ✨: Measure the magical power of your PowerShell scripts.
